}
\arguments{
\item{dirpath}{Path to the directory where Glottography data will be stored and processed.}

\item{dataset}{The dataset (or project) name, e.g., "walker2011bayesian".}

}
\value{
A dataframe containing the processed data for the specified polygon set.
}
\description{
This function is designed to download and process Glottography data hosted on GitHub.
It allows users to specify a dataset and a polygon set (features, languages, or families) to
retrieve spatial information about languages and language families. The function downloads
the data, processes the GeoJSON files locally, and returns the relevant data in a structured format.
}
\details{
Purpose:

1. **Download Glottography data**:
   - The function downloads the specified dataset and polygon set from the GitHub repository.
   - Users confirm the download process via a prompt.

2. **Process and Load Glottography Data**:
   - Reads and processes the downloaded GeoJSON file.
   - Extracts the relevant attributes and retains geometry for spatial analysis and visualization.

3. **Augment Data**:
   - Ensures the resulting dataset is well-structured and ready for analysis.

Result:
- The returned dataset contains the attributes specified in the chosen polygon set, such as language IDs
  or family-level polygons, depending on the selection.

Files Processed:
- `features.geojson`: The raw polygons representing linguistic data.
- `languages.geojson`: Polygons aggregated at the language level.
- `families.geojson`: Polygons aggregated at the top-level family level.

Key Outputs:
- A structured dataframe containing the attributes from the selected polygon set, including geometry.
